				<h2>Bohnanza</h2>
				<img src="images/Bohnanza.jpg" alt="Bohnanza box art. released 1997"><img src="images/bohnanza_large02.jpg" alt="Example of cards">
				<p>Bohnanza is a card game about trading beans. It was one of the first german style games that I was introduced to around 2007. You start with a hard of 7 random beans out of the 11 different type of beans. You start with 2 possible bean fields, with an object of making points planting beans. On your turn you plant 1 or 2 fields, then pull 2 bean cards off the top of the card deck and deal with them by either planting or trading with other players. Scoring is based on the number of beans in that feild that you sell for coins. Winner is the player with the most coins after 3 rounds. Game time is usually around 30 to 90 minutes.</p>
			
				<h2>Power Grid</h2>
				<img src="images/PowerGrid.jpg" alt="Powergrid box art."><img src="images/powerGridBoard.jpg" alt="Example of board and pieces">
				<p>Power Grid is a game where each player is a power company that supplies electricity to cities. You buy power plants and expand into new cities based on how many cities you are able to power with the plants you have bought. The games usually runs over 2 hours, and balances very well. There are usually a number of lead changes on each game before the game gets to the final turn.</p>
			
				<h2>Colony</h2>
				<img src="images/colony.png" alt="Colony box art."><img src="images/colonyboardback.jpeg" alt="Back of game box showing examples of game pieces">
				<p>Colony is a engine building game in which you use dice as a resource builder to buy buildings. These buildings help gain or manipulate the dice you roll every round. The game immediatly ends when a certain number of points is reached (depending on number of players from 15 to 18). Play time is around 60 to 90 minutes.</p>
			
				<h2>Plague Inc.</h2>
				<img src="images/PlagueInc.gif" alt="Plague Inc. box art."><img src="images/plagueincboard.png" alt="Example of Plague Inc. setup">
				<p>Plague Inc. is a board game adaptation of a mobile game of the same name. You play a virus or a bacteria that tries to infect countries. Once all the cities in a country are infeced you then roll a dice to attempt to kill the country on the board. I find it to be a very interesting oppositinal game, but still easy to learn and teach.</p>
			
				<h2>The Game</h2>
				<img src="images/TheGame.jpg" alt="The Game box art."><img src="images/The-Game-hand.jpg" alt="Example of The Game play">
				<p>The Game is a cooperative card game that plays 2 to 5 players. It contains cards from 2 to 99 that you work with your fellow players to discard from your hand in order. There are 2 piles that go down from 100, and 2 piles that go up from 1. You cannot share specific information (hey stop I have number 17), but can share general information (wait, I can fix that). There is a reset mechanism in the game that allows you to reverse the pile by exactly 10 if you ahve the cards (30 can be played on top of 40 to reduce the up from 1 piles by 10). The Game usually takes aboue 15 to 30 minutes to play.</p>
